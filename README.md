# Project 1 - Skill building and stakeholder communication

* Communicating the value of data analysis is key to building a data-driven decision making culture
* This project was focused on developing an application that allows users to experience linear regression and how it can help inform decisions
* The R Shiny Application was deployed on shinyapps.io

# Project 2 - Improved decision making capability

* Forecasting output is a key capability for most teams
* Utilizing an average to predict future performance is risky
* Probabilistic forecasting helps provide more confidence behind estimates
* This R Shiny Application was designed for users to input historical data and develop forecasts with varying levels of confidence
